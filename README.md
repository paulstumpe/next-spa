This is a Next.js + React + TypeScript single-page app scaffolded with `create-next-app` (App Router) and Tailwind CSS.

## Requirements

- Node.js: >= 18.18 or >= 20.9 (Node 19.8+ also works)

## Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
# or: yarn dev / pnpm dev / bun dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000

The SPA lives in `app/page.tsx` and demonstrates simple client-side interactivity (name input + counter). Edit and save to hotâ€‘reload.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Deploy

Any Node host works. For easiest DX, deploy to Vercel: https://vercel.com
